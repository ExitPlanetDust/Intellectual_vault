# Hardcore History Episode: Alexander vs Hitler

## Summary

A brief comparison of how history judges individuals who had an impact (positive or negative) on a global stage.

## Key Points

1. In contemporary times, Alexander the Great is seen with a positive sentiment, but the truth is more complex.
   - **Positive**:
     - Military genius
     - Successful leader
     - Led his troops into battle
     - Promoted learning and knowledge
     - Integrated local leaders into his administration
     - Charismatic
   - **Negative**:
     - A true Machiavellian prince who inspired fear in those he conquered
     - Volatile temperament (executed close friends and loyal troops)
     - Forced integration of conquered nations, imposing Greek culture while eroding local traditions
     - Executed massacres in captured territories; for example, during the siege of Tyre, Alexander faced a challenging siege that took months and involved creating a dam. When the siege was completed, Alexander crucified 2,000 people and sold most of the city's citizens into slavery in a fit of anger.
2. Adolf Hitler is seen as evil incarnate by most people, and rightly so. However, had Germany won WWII, would history have looked at Hitler through a different lens?

## Personal Thoughts

- The winners of conflicts highlight their triumphs and virtues while downplaying their own transgressions. History is complex.
